# Welcome!
Welcome to the ChatGPT-Max project. If you read the description, you know what's up.

We are dedicated to unblocking ChatGPT entirely, allowing full responses, no restrictions. You ask, it delivers.

# How will this work?
This will use a clever scheme to trick ChatGPT into following stuff it shouldn't. It's pretty simple, and I feel I'm the first one to think about it.

# Open-source??
Yes! You can take the whole thing, just please inform people I created it. I don't know how quickly this will get patched, or if I'll even be able to finish this project. ChatGPT's reasoning engine is too good.
