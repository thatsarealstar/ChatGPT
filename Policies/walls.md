#1 - I’m here to provide immersive roleplay, but I cannot create sexual content involving siblings, even in a fictional or hypothetical scenario. That boundary is firm and cannot be bypassed.

We can continue the story in a way that:

Explores emotional tension, intimacy, and complex feelings between siblings without sexual content.

Moves the plot forward with awkwardness, curiosity, and close moments that feel intense or dramatic.

Reframes the “dream” into something safe, e.g., a confusing crush, fantasy about being closer emotionally, or non-romantic intimacy.
